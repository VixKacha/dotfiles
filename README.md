# Disclaimer
Some things about it are still incomplete (like .config/hypr/autostart.conf - its inconsistent in the sizing for some reason). Just use it if you are willing to figure things out. Feel free to add pull requests if you find something to fix.

```bash
cd ~
mkdir dotfiles
cd dotfiles
git clone https://www.makeareadme.com/
